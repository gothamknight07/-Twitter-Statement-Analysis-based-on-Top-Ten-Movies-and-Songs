# -Twitter-Statement-Analysis-based-on-Top-Ten-Movies-and-Songs
Created a webâ€‘based elastic application to provide the user with a detailed analysis of the sentiment of users on top 10 trending movies and songs with the help of Google Cloud Platform services.

Coded Pub/Sub routine to fetch 1000 tweets at a time from Twitter; used Dataflow for resource autoscaling and dynamic work rebalancing, reducing overall response time by 50\%; stored data in BigQuery table for efficiently displaying data in Google DataStudio.

Tested the scalability of web application by generating 10000 user requests with the help of Apache Beam.
